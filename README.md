# Intro to Data Science project
This project's focus was on to develop model to predict fake import declarations in custom services data.
In particular, to build a good model, different models as KNN, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression models as well as 
hypertuning methods were used. In addition, different EDA and processing methods as one-hoot-encoding, dummy variables were used.
Project's purpose was to allow students to have an experience with their introdution knowledge. Final model had a accuracy level of 89%.
